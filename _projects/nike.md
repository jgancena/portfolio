description: The Nike Running Flatiron store in NYC serves as one of Nike’s main running flagship locations. To capture the energy that surrounds the store and its dedicated running community, we worked closely with Nike to develop two social media wall installations. One installation lives as a floor-to-cieling LED screen in the entranceway to the store, while the second installation lives on an 84” flat screen surrounded by Nike Running products. The Social Wall Application feature a datavis of Tweets, Twitter Pics, Instagram, Instagram Videos, Facebook Posts, Facebook Images and Nike branded imagery / videos.
