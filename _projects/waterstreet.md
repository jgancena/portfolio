description: Tampa is on the precipice of a bold transformation. Water Street Tampa is a vibrant vision for the future of Tampa Bay and for the 23,000+ people who live, work, study, and visit the city each day. With Tampa creating new stories, we built a website to showcase the forthcoming experiences that the public can expect.
