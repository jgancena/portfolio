description: Florida Poly University is the nation’s premier STEM institution. We were tasked with setting the vision for the new website. The goal was to accurately represent the institution’s changing and dynamic culture. The new site was built to primarily attract prospective students and STEM fanatics. We purposefully created a system of modules that could be easily integrated throughout the site while adjusting to new content.
