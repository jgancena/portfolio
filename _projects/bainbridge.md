description: When Bainbridge came to us, they wanted to create a brand that tied back to what represented not only their team, but their propertyâ€”inspiring, empowering, captivating, sophisticated, connected and innovative. Every design detail was crafted intentionally. From the brand voice and audience to the color palette and typography choices, there is rationale behind every choice.
