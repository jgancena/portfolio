description: Fleming's came to Sparxoo looking for us to craft a genuine look and feel for their social and digital presence. The goal was to create interest and drive reservations for their holiday offerings and private dining experiences. We included more human elements and let the food determine how each scene was staged. We shot the food as it came out of the kitchen, without beauty modifications, so the experience online matched the in-restaurant presentation. Also helping to create a new menu concept and design, we leveraged locally curated pairings of both steak and wine for the reopening of their flagship location in Newport Beach, California.
