description: The Tampa Bay Chamber is passionate in connecting leaders in our community, championing diverse community perspectives and supporting quality growth. When we created the Chamber's new brand, we knew it had to reflect the followingâ€”trust, inspiration, inclusivity and influence. The idea of upward and forward movement was an important guiding factor that we wanted to thread throughout the brand.
