description: Since 1984, Joffrey's Coffee & Tea Company's passion for exceptional coffee and tea has been the heart of what they do. Creating an experience that matched their whimsical nature was integral to our team. Rooted in Tampa and wanting to share the joy of Joffreyâ€™s far and wide, we led our design with a focus on simplicity, clarity and usability.
