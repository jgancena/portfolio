description: Disruptive design. Experiential architecture. That’s how we built the new BDG Architects website — with the firm’s guiding principles in mind. Matching their focus on thoughtful design, we were very intentional with every decision. Movement and motion throughout the site is meant to not only add moments of surprise, but to provide subtle cues to guide the user along their journey.
